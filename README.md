# PsychoLucidia's Profile

I'm PsychoLucidia, an aspiring Game Programmer and composer/producer. 

Most of my experience is mostly making music and I know that game development is one hell of a ride to start with, but that won't stop me from becoming an aspiring developer.

I make music as a sideline and I mostly do EDM and Orchestral stuff.
